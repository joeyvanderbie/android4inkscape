Android Inkscape Extension

Deploy

1) Install Inkscape from the web.  http://inkscape.org/download/
2) copy android.py and android.inx into the extensions folder in your inkscape installation.

Usage

1) select the part of your drawing you would like to export.
2) select Extensions->Android->Export
3) Fill in the name of the image you would like to export.  The root path to your android project.  The smallest image size (ldpi).   Whether you would like to maintain the aspect ratio or export as a square.  It ain't fast, particularly the first time, but it ain't manual either.
